rerank(
  model,

  top_n = NULL,
  return_documents = TRUE,
  tidy = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The reranking model to use. Available models include:
- "pinecone-rerank-v0"
See Pinecone documentation for the full list of available models.}

\item{query}{The query string to rank documents against.}

\item{documents}{A character vector of documents to rerank, or a list of
named lists where each contains a "text" field (and optionally an "id" field).}

\item{top_n}{The number of top results to return. Default is to return all documents.}

\item{return_documents}{Whether to include the document text in the response.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{tidy}{Whether to return a tidy tibble format (default: TRUE).}
