Description: Provides a comprehensive R interface to the Pinecone Vector
    Database API. Supports index management (create, configure, delete),
    collection operations, vector operations (query, upsert, fetch, update,
    delete, list), inference operations (embed, rerank), integrated inference
    (records upsert/search with auto-embedding), and bulk import operations.
    Uses the Pinecone Global API (api.pinecone.io). Enables similarity search
    and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflows from R.
